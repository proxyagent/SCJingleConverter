# SCJingleConverter
ALL CREDIT GOES TO GREGGERSAURUS! The original repo can be found here: https://github.com/greggersaurus/OpenSteamController/tree/master/Jingle
 
This particular repo is designed to make loading jingles on your Steam controller fast and simple without having to download and use QT / QT Creator to build and run the GUI for SCJingleConverter. For a step by step guide, refer to the original repo above and follow the steps excluding "Building SCJingleConverter". 

As of now I have not been able to test on a Windows 11 machine, although I have successfully ran and loaded jingles using both of my Windows 10 machines.

The code was compiled and deployed using Qt 5.12.12 (MinGW 7.3.0 64-bit). 

No changes were made to the codebase / GUI.
