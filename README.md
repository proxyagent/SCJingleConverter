# SCJingleConverter
-ALL CREDIT GOES TO GREGGERSAURUS!- 

The original repo can be found here: https://github.com/greggersaurus/OpenSteamController/tree/master/Jingle
 
This particular repo is designed to make loading jingles on your Steam controller fast and simple without having to download and use Qt 5.12.12 (MinGW 64-bit) / QT Creator 4.9.0 to build and run the GUI for SCJingleConverter. For a step by step guide, refer to the original repo above and follow the steps excluding "Building SCJingleConverter". 

As of now I have not been able to test on Windows 11, although I have successfully ran and loaded jingles using both of my Windows 10 machines.

The code was compiled and deployed on Windows 10 using Qt 5.12.12 (MinGW 7.3.0 64-bit). 

No changes were made to the SCJingleConverter code / GUI.

*Update

I have had a chance to launch the exe on Windows 11, although there are some visual bugs. Everything is still fairly readable and you can still easily understand what does what. I have not been able to test further than launching the exe. I will have more time later this week to see if the application functions as its intended.
